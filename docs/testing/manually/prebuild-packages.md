Prebuild Packages
=================

There are some circumstances in which the Patch Tester cannot be used. In such cases it is possible to download an update package containing the changes from a specific pull request.

Use the *View on GitHub* link in the Patch Tester and then scroll down to the *All checks have passed* section. Select the *Show all checks* link. One of the items is *Download â€” Prebuilt packages are available for download.* but the Details button leads to a *Not Found* page.

Content incomplete: see [Testing_Joomla!_patches](https://docs.joomla.org/Testing_Joomla!_patches) for the complete but outdated version.
